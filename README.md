# Pixin

[Pixie](https://github.com/pixiemc) + [Mixin](https://github.com/SpongePowered/Mixin) = Pixin
It makes Pixie work via a mixin. 1.20.1 only because that's what I did it in, no reason it can't do it otherwise and there's probably a way to make it do fancy things but I didn't.

## Usage

1. Install Essential & Pixin
2. Run the game once with Essential
3. Remove the original Essential jar from your mods folder
4. Copy the actual Essential mod from `<minecraft dir>/essential` (it'll be a .jar and be something like `Essential (fabric_1.20.1).jar`) to your mods folder.
5. Run the game

## Clarifications of Licenses

No, I'm not associated with Pixie or Essential.
No, this doesn't use Essential code.
Yes, ask me for licensing stuff Pixie people if you want. (or just do it yourself, it's not that complex of a thing to do (despite how long it took))
