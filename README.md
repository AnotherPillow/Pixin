# Pixin

[Pixie](https://github.com/pixiemc) + [Mixin](https://github.com/SpongePowered/Mixin) = Pixin
It makes Pixie work via a mixin. 1.20.1 only because that's what I did it in, no reason it can't do it otherwise and there's probably a way to make it do fancy things but I didn't.

## Usage

1. Install Essential & Pixin
2. Run the game once with Essential
3. Remove the original Essential jar from your mods folder
4. Copy the actual Essential mod from `<minecraft dir>/essential` (it'll be a .jar and be something like `Essential (fabric_1.20.1).jar`) to your mods folder.
5. Run the game
